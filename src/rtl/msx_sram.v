 msx_sram.v

 The SRAM of the board (two byte lanes of 2M x 8, 10 ns, asynchronous) as one byte port of the
 machine: a byte address of 22 bits (MA = addr[21:1], the lane by addr[0]: MWR_N[0] / MD[7:0] for
 even bytes, as the NES core has it). /OE (MRD_N) is tied low by the top.

 Slots of two clocks (clk 42.857 MHz: one clock, 23.3 ns, is less than the address out, tAA and
 the data in; two are 46.7 ns, TS_SRAM_OUT / TS_SRAM_IN of the ucf bound the pads):
 - the first edge of a slot takes the address (and a pending write) into the address registers;
 - a read slot takes MD at the first edge of the next slot (two clocks after the address), dout
   is the byte of its lane one clock later;
 - a write slot pulls /WE low and drives MD from the falling edge of its first clock to the
   falling edge of its second clock, so the address is stable half a clock before and after /WE.
 The SRAM is read all the time at addr: dout follows a change of addr within seven clocks (the
 port goes through a register first), which is far less than the access of the Z80 (an M1 read
 takes the data two T-states, 24 clocks, after the address). The machine and the loaders hold
 addr while they read.

 we is a level or a pulse: the rising edge requests one write of din at addr (taken at that
 edge; both must hold until then). A write waits for the next slot, at most two clocks; the
 writers here write once in 10 clocks or less often (the loaders of the mcu, the Z80).

 The aux port (the disk image cache, msx_fdd_cache): aux_req held with aux_addr / aux_we /
 aux_din until aux_ack (one clock; with a read aux_dout is the byte then). The slots alternate
 between the machine and the aux port; a slot of the aux port without a request is the
 machine's. With requests all the time, the machine has every other slot: its reads take up to
 nine clocks, under a T-state of the Z80 (12); a request of the aux port takes four to six.
